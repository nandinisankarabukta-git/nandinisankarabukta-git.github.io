Here is a list of the various projects I worked on.

## Decuber

Decuber is a Rubik's Cube-inspired message encoder built with HTML, CSS, JS, and Python.  
It converts characters into color pairs using a 6-color scheme, storing 4 characters per cube face.  
The included Python script [`DecuberBase36.py`](https://github.com/h4ckxel/Decuber/blob/main/DecuberBase36.py) extends functionality to encode any binary data (text, images, ZIPs) into base36 and then into cube colors.  
This version supports CLI encoding/decoding, optional OpenSSL encryption, and works on Linux, macOS, and WSL.  
It requires Python 3.x and has no external dependencies.

## Didactic-Darakeet

A project designed to facilitate fluid and natural communication with deaf and mute people. It uses an application based on the Mediapipe framework for real-time visual sign language recognition, enabling two-way translation between speech/text and sign language.

> **Note:** Code improvements are currently underway to enhance functionality and maintainability.

## Agujero_Negro_Simulador (Black Hole Simulator)

This is a Black Hole Simulator project developed primarily in **C++** using ray tracing and geodesics calculation to visualize the gravitational effects (such as gravitational lensing) of a black hole. It includes C++ source files (`ray_tracing.cpp`, `CPU-geodesic.cpp`) and shader files (`geodesic.comp`, `grid.frag`, `grid.vert`).

## FiltroGaussiano (Gaussian Filter)

This Python script performs **Image Smoothing with a Gaussian Filter** on a grayscale image using the `NumPy`, `SciPy`, and `Pillow` libraries. It loads an image, applies a controllable Gaussian blur by adjusting the `sigma` value, and displays both the original and filtered images for comparison.
